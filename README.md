Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this project I made a house using multiple shapes, as per the requirements.

This project was made from scratch, and I looked through documentation for how to make the various shapes. 

For making polygons, I looked at the following [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13204562/proper-format-for-drawing-polygon-data-in-d3) for reference.
